# SalletView

A standalone Windows application that provides an interactible overlay to help improve focus when reading

This app tints the entire screen and produces a differently-tinted rectangle that follows the cursor. The idea here being that with this method of highlighting, it might improve, and help to maintain, focus especially when reading large bodies of text by only have one section highlighted at a time
## Features

- Customisable width, height, and colour of the highlight rectangle
- Customisable opacity and colour of the background
- Persistent settings
